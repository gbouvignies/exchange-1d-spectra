    "## 1. The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we examine a protein undergoing chemical exchange between two states, **A** and **B**, each characterized by distinct chemical environments. The exchange process is represented by the equation:\n",

    "$$ A \\underset{\\kba}{\\stackrel{\\kab}{\\rightleftharpoons}} B \\tag{1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\kab$ and $\\kba$ are the forward and reverse rate constants, respectively, both of which are first-order. The sum of these rate constants, $\\kex = \\kab + \\kba$, represents the overall exchange rate. The fractional populations of states **A** and **B** are denoted as $\\pa$ and $\\pb$, respectively, with the constraint that $\\pa + \\pb = 1$. The lifetimes of states **A** and **B** are defined as $\\tau_A = 1/\\kab$ and $\\tau_B = 1/\\kba$. The timescale of the exchange process is defined as $\\tau_{ex} = 1 / \\kex$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the subsequent discussion, we focus on a specific nucleus within the protein. For this nucleus, the chemical shift (measured in rad·s<sup>-1</sup>) is $\\wa$ in state **A** and $\\wb$ in state **B**, with a difference of $\\Delta \\omega_{AB} = \\wb - \\wa$.\n",

    "<img src=\"Images/chemical_exchange.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1**: Spectra of <sup>15</sup>N nucleus undergoing chemical exchange in an 800 MHz magnet, simulated using the Bloch-McConnell equations. $\\Delta \\delta_{AB} = 3$ ppm and $\\pb = 0.5$ on the left and $\\pb = 0.05$ on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1** shows a series of spectra calculated using the Bloch-McConnell equations (13) as a function of $\\kex$. The left panel illustrates the scenario where the populations of the two states are equal ($\\pa = \\pb = 0.5$). When the exchange is slow ($\\kex \\ll \\Delta \\omega_{AB}$), two peaks are present. These peaks broaden as the exchange rate increases and eventually merge into a single, very broad peak at $\\kex \\approx \\Delta \\omega_{AB}$, a phenomenon known as coalescence. In the fast exchange regime ($\\kex \\gg \\Delta \\omega_{AB}$), a narrow peak appears at the average position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more intriguing situation arises when the populations are highly skewed, with $\\pa \\gg \\pb$ (right panel of **Figure 1**). In the slow exchange regime, two peaks are present at positions $ω_{A}$ and $ω_{B}$, with their volumes proportional to the populations. As the exchange rate increases, the peak corresponding to the minor state (**B**) experiences significant line broadening, rapidly becoming invisible. The peak corresponding to the major state (**A**), however, remains visible and broadens as it approaches the coalescence limit, albeit to a lesser extent than resonance **B**. As the exchange becomes faster, the peak narrows and ultimately appears at the position corresponding to the weighted average of the two states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exchange regime is determined by the ratio of the exchange rate ($\\kex$) to the chemical shift difference between the two states ($\\Delta \\omega_{AB}$), $\\kex / \\Delta \\omega_{AB}$. Thus, one can push the system toward a slower (faster) exchange regime either by decreasing (increasing) $\\kex$, which can be achieved by changing the experimental conditions such as temperature, pH, or ionic strength of the buffer, or by increasing (decreasing) $\\Delta \\omega_{AB}$, which is easily done by running the experiment at a higher (lower) static magnetic field, $\\text{B}_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations can be further quantitatively described by examining the approximate solutions of the Bloch-McConnell equations for the two limiting cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1. Slow Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "In the slow exchange regime, $\\kex \\ll \\left| i\\Delta \\omega_{AB} + \\Delta R_2 \\right|$, Equation (13) simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M^+(t) = M_\\text{A}^+(0) \\exp\\left[\\left( i\\omega_A - R_2^A - \\kab \\right)t\\right] +\n",
    "M_\\text{B}^+(0) \\exp\\left[\\left( i\\omega_B - R_2^B - \\kba \\right)t\\right] \\tag{19}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, we observe two resonances at positions corresponding to states **A** and **B**. However, the exchange process adds to the effective relaxation rates of the two peaks, leading to larger linewidths, with $R_{\\text{2,eff}}^\\text{A} = R_2^A + \\kab$ and $R_{\\text{2,eff}}^\\text{B} = R_2^B + \\kba$ for states **A** and **B**, respectively. In the case where $\\pa \\gg \\pb$, i.e., $\\kba \\gg \\kab$, the exchange contribution to the linewidth of peak **B** becomes much larger than that of peak **A**. For example, assuming $\\kex = 1000 \\text{ s}^{-1}$ and $\\pb = 2\\%$, we have $\\kab = 20 \\text{ s}^{-1}$ and $\\kba = 980 \\text{ s}^{-1}$, making peak **B** too broad to be detected in the NMR spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2. Fast Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fast exchange regime, $\\kex \\gg \\left| i\\Delta \\omega_{AB} + \\Delta R_2 \\right|$, Equation (13) approximates to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M^+(t) = M^+(0) \\exp\\left[\\left( i\\overline{\\omega} - \\overline{R_2} -\n",
    "\\frac{\\pa\\pb \\Delta \\omega_{AB}^2}{\\kex} \\right)t\\right] \\tag{20}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\overline{R_2} = \\pa R_2^A + \\pb R_2^B$ and $\\overline{\\omega} = \\pa \\omega_A + \\pb \\omega_B$ are the population-averaged transverse relaxation rate and chemical shift, respectively. Here, only a single line at the weighted-average position is observed with a linewidth corresponding to the average relaxation rate, plus a contribution due to the exchange process. Interestingly, while the exchange-induced relaxation rate increase is independent of the $\\text{B}_0$ field in the slow exchange regime, it varies quadratically with $\\omega_{AB}$, and thus as $\\text{B}_0^{2}$, in the fast exchange regime.\n",

    "## 8. Kinetics of a Binding Equilibrium E + L $\\rightleftharpoons$ EL\n",
    "\n",
    "Describing the effect of ligand binding on the observed line shapes of a target molecule constitutes a specific case of a two-state equilibrium. The target molecule can exist in either the free or bound state, and the relative populations of these states are defined by the dissociation equilibrium constant, $\\Kd$, and the concentrations of the ligand, $L_0$, and the target molecule, $E_0$, according to the law of mass action:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Kd = \\frac{\\koff}{\\kon} = \\frac{[E][L]}{[EL]} \\tag{21} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $[E]$ and $[L]$ represent the concentrations of the free target molecule and the ligand, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we denote $\\pb$ as the bound fraction of E ($\\pb = [EL]/E_0$), $\\pb$ is one of the roots of the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pb^2 - \\pb\\left(1 + \\frac{L_0}{E_0} + \\frac{\\Kd}{E_0}\\right) + \\frac{L_0}{E_0} = 0\n",
    "\\tag{22}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\kex$ will be defined by the number of E molecules that form a complex per unit time and the number of complexes that dissociate at the same time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\kex = \\kon[L] + \\koff = \\kon\\left([L] + \\Kd\\right) \\tag{23} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation (23) shows that the line shapes depend on the total concentration of the ligand as well as the dissociation equilibrium constants. Therefore, three cases are usually observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1. Slow Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation occurs when the dissociation constant $\\Kd$ is very small compared to the concentration of the target molecule $E_0$ (strong binding). The formation of the complex is limited by a very slow dissociation rate, namely $\\kon \\cdot \\Kd$. During acquisition, molecules are \"frozen\" in either their bound or free states, and the two corresponding lines are visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2. Fast Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "When the dissociation constant $\\Kd$ is larger than the concentration of the target molecule (weak binding), the dissociation rate becomes very fast compared to the frequency difference between the free state ($\\nuf$) and the bound state ($\\nub$), leading to a single resonance whose frequency is the weighted average of these frequencies. Thus, the measurement of the frequency ($\\num$) as a function of the total ligand concentration $L_0$ provides an accurate and precise measurement of the bound fraction $\\pb$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\pb(L_0) = \\frac{\\num - \\nuf}{\\nub - \\nuf} \\tag{24} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting the experimental values of $\\pb$ as a function of $L_0$ to equation (22) provides a way to determine the dissociation equilibrium constant. Note that while $\\nuf$ is easy to determine, $\\nub$ may be challenging to measure accurately since 100% of the complex may not be reachable due to weak binding. Therefore, the non-linear fitting procedure often uses both $\\Kd$ and $\\nub$ as adjustable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.3. Intermediate Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "In this situation, the on and off exchange rates match the frequency difference between the bound and free states of the observed molecule. This results in a situation where resonances vanish upon the addition of the ligand. In such cases, one can attempt to escape this regime by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Changing the temperature (if possible).\n",
    "- Changing the static magnetic field strength, $\\text{B}_0$, or the observed nuclei to obtain a different $\\Delta \\omega$ value and subsequently define another time window.\n",
